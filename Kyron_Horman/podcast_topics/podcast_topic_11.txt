So, I mean, put perspective. 1200 large number. Five days Kyron went missing, family released statement press. They thanked public support appealed people continue search effort looking properties. Okay.
So there's couple things here, Gibbs. Less two weeks Kyron disappeared, scaled back appeared pretty massive search effort. Again, type massive search effort cannot continue indefinitely. It can't. No, costly.
Yeah. More searches somewhere else. Sure. So extremely tough family. Not Kyron missing, seeing efforts kind dwindle days go by. That's tough. Now, sudden, appears though they're focusing specific roads, specific bodies water, they're saying why. Yeah.
I think want accountability 90 minutes. In late July, according Associated Press, $25,000 reward offer information leading discovery Chiron increased $50,000.
Yeah, I agree you. I did. As 2000 came end, total cost searches point came around $1.4 million. Yeah, that's lot. And hate ever put price tag searches, right? But still accounted for. Money factor.
We said end 2010, $1.4 million spent. I want talk specificity locations. My assumption is, Gibbs, came 4,200 tips. Yeah.
