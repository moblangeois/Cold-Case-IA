The first family knew disappearance failed arrive home school bus. And Gibbs, I know talked number podcasts, kind looking window daughters younger, seeing get bus. And I would follow made front door. I made sure got inside.
If one girls failed get bus, I'm thinking right now. The feeling I would pit stomach wondering what's going on. And actually, I've feeling before. I remember one time youngest stay school something school. Right. And everybody forgot tell it. Oh, man.
I freaking out. I called wife phone. Obviously quickly told was. So anxiety level came down. But first instant, first couple minutes, I panic stricken. Sure. Unbearable panic.
And December following year, couple daughter named Kiera. Kyron started school Skyline Elementary rural area Northwest Portland, two miles Horman home. Terry involved Kyron's upbringing.
So I think important kind paint picture family dynamics, environment Kyron grew in, players, actors, everyone involved. On June 4th, 2010, Terry drove Kyron school. Now, noted usually took bus.
But day, project drop school science fair classes started. And I remember days. My kids, like I said, normally rode bus. Yeah. There days big project due. And I say big, I mean big take bus. So needed driven. Yeah. To school dropped off. It done. I remember-
I driven back day I always took bus. And I remember I science fair project I big sheet plywood I decided topography Asia. Yeah.
So I got bags sawdust I glue I making like topography would lay out. And looked good I took sheet plywood it, got friend's mom's van.
And kind hold way I held it. And I kind watched kind slide. So great glue. I know impresses story. The fact know word topography. It rough. And used correctly. Yeah. Or chose Asia. Yeah.
I know. I'm actually impressed whole thing. But reported Kyron working hard exhibit, red-eyed tree frog, Terry helped take school arrived around 8 a.m. Kyron also due participate school's talent show day, scheduled 1 2.45 p.m.
So Terry Kyron first went Kyron's classroom dropped coat backpack heading science fair, held school grounds. The president school PTA later told police saw Terry Kyron together around 8 15 AM standing front Kyron's exhibit Terry took photographs.
By way, one ever took photos science project, ever. Well, could they? It sounds like ended friend's mom's minivan. It did, still, photo would nice. You're going take photo floor minivan? Yeah. This going be. There's Asia.
According Terry's account, stayed another half hour leaving 8.45 a.m. bell rang. She watched Kyron walked hall classroom went run errands.
Kyron always took bus home school usually arrived around 3.30 PM. But later day school, Terry Kane Kiera walked school bus meet him. He there. And I think Gibbs, confused probably extremely worried bus driver told Kyron gotten bus first place.
It around 3 45 PM worried Terry called school see Kyron was. Her anxiety increased told class day even marked absent morning homeroom teacher. That's huge problem. Huge. Well, especially put context much time elapsed.
Right. So obviously situation missed bus. Right. Because we're going way from, know, three 30 PM back eight 45 AM. Nearly seven hours. Because never showed first class. Yeah.
After Terry called school, school secretary called 911 report Kyron missing. And obviously, know, family extremely concerned. He said quiet, introverted kid.
He outgoing. He adventurous. So would completely character wandered school own. And Gibbs, I know something talked many times, right? The first 24 hours, first 48 hours someone goes missing extremely critical investigation. Yeah.
Terry told police saying goodbye Kyron around 8 45 AM, went Fred Myers get groceries two separate locations. She also explained daughter Kiera earache. So Terry drove daughter around town 10 10 11 40 AM attempt help alleviate pain.
The constant motion vehicle good earache. Maybe that's something works. I know. Afterward, Terry said went workout local gym stayed 1240 p.m. going home. At 121 p.m., posted photos Facebook she'd taken Kyron science fair morning.
run fingers short hair again. I miss hug anytime I want. Nighttime always hard me. I miss much want back I protect horrible things world. I can't believe still us. I pray come back I'm afraid I can't live without you.
I miss every second every day. I would give life yours. I want back safe. You must come back us. So, I mean, that's tear jerking. It Gibbs. There's way around it. You feel pain, longing want son back. Yeah.
Gibbs, waste time. He moved family home June 26th, taking 18 month old Kiera him. So sound like lot doubts probably took place. I think felt like, yeah, I think might tried set up. So I'm here.
He said Terry relentlessly critical school's teaching staff kind seemed unhappy overall. Well, substitute teacher, obviously probably thoughts teaching. And postpartum, I mean, yeah, maybe happy all. And postpartum depression pretty rough.
The school real strict, apparently enforcing use visitor badges. It also reported nine unlocked doors school, lot. It's lot. It also allowed pretty much anyone street access building unnoticed.
One legacies came Kyron's case overhaul school security measures throughout Portland. These days, visitors Skyline Elementary access building one unlocked door front. They're required sign in. All elementary schools throughout Portland indoor outdoor surveillance cameras installed. And I think
starting become, maybe point become norm. I know kids like middle school, like Fort Knox. I mean, buzzed one door let second door. It's like a, like bank. Yeah.
halls schools children attend. It safe haven. But like everything else talk Gibbs, right? It takes something horrible. Yeah. Sometimes put thought someone's head need it. Right. It's time change. Yes. And I mean, sad, kind way works. Yeah. If could proactive time, would great, can't think everything.
uncovered uncovered? I know, I think stage now, need pieces puzzle move forward.
