So case, well James Bolger case, really high list requested cases we've number years. They really have. In June 2010.
So big case, tough case. Yeah. I think always tough you're, talking young child, I say case people really cling to, right? They get fascinated by, know, details. It led lot speculation about, know, involved disappearance. And continues, right?
So, I mean, one thing jump within three hours, sheriff already reached FBI. Things moving forward.

stopped short categorizing abduction. In first 72 hours, police inundated around 1,200 tips. That's lot. That's big number. I mean, I done myriad cases. I think talked John List couple weeks ago. They profiled America's Most Wanted, I think got 200 300 tips. Yeah.
Yes, costly law enforcement perspective, also lot volunteers can't spend month month month. They volunteered time, lot people long. And resources like mountain rescue, national guard. Okay. There things need doing.

least point detectives able charge anyone. The Multnomah County Sheriff told KOIN 6 News even Kyron found, mean arrest can't made. Well, that's true, right? We've seen many cases before. Sure. Is harder? Yeah, I think is.
Well, harder arrest somebody. You arrest somebody, get conviction, I think harder, possible put evidence together. I think us, need look possible scenarios.
And we've seen cases like past. We have. And I think talk stranger abduction, right? Now talk context one seeing Kyron leave, nobody seeing anybody else 2010, right?
But I think people do. I think people look things. They put together say, something's right.
