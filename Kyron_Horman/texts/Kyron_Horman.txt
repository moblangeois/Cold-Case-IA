Kyron Horman
Victim
Kyron Horman was second grader at Skyline Elementary in Portland Oregon. He loved the outdoors, and especially enjoyed visiting beaches, zoo's and aquariums. Kyron's family specifically remembers Kyron particularly enjoying two family vacation's to Disney World and Hawaii. Kyron was particularly intelligent for a second grader; he excelled in school, was placed into advanced math classes, and even began picking up sign language. Kyron's smile was big enough to light up a room and more than enough to draw a smile on anyone face who had the pleasure of meeting him. Wears glasses
