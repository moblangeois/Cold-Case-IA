 Disappearance
 On June 4, 2010, Kyron was taken to Skyline Elementary School by his stepmother Terri Horman
 (Moulton),
 [5] who then stayed with him while he attended a 
science fair.
 [6] Terri Horman stated that she
 left the school at around 8:45 a.m. and that she last remembered seeing Kyron walking down the hall to
 his class.
 [7] However, Kyron was never seen in his first class and was instead marked as absent that day.
Terri's statements to the police indicate that, after leaving the school at 8:45 a.m., she ran errands at two
 different 
Fred Meyer grocery stores until about 10:10 a.m.
 [8] Between then and 11:39 a.m., she stated that
 she was driving her daughter around town in an attempt to use the motion of the vehicle to soothe the
 toddler's 
earache. Terri said that she then went to a local gym and exercised until about 12:40 p.m. By
 1:21 p.m., she had arrived home and posted photos of Kyron at the science fair on 
Facebook.

 At 3:30 p.m., Terri and her husband, Kaine, walked with their daughter, Kiara, to the bus stop to meet
 Kyron. The bus driver told them that the boy had not boarded the bus, and to call the school to ask his
 whereabouts. Terri did so, only to be informed by the school secretary that, as far as anyone there knew,
 Kyron had not been at school since early that day and that he had accordingly been marked absent.
 Realizing then that the boy was 
missing, the secretary called 
9-1-1
