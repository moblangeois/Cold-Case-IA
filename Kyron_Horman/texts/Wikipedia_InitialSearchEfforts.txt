 Initial search efforts
 Search efforts for Kyron were extensive and primarily focused on a 2-mile (3.2 km) radius around
 Skyline Elementary and on 
Sauvie Island, approximately 6 miles (9.7 km) away.
 [10] Law enforcement did
 not disclose their reasons for searching the area where they did, which included a search of the 
Island Bridge.

 On June 9, 2010, the Horman family, who had initially refused to
 speak with the media, released a statement:
 Kyron's family would like to thank people for support
 and interest in finding their son. The outpouring of
 support and continued effort strengthens their hope. We
 need for folks to continue to assist us in our goal. Please
 search your properties â€” cars, out buildings, sheds, etc.
 Also check with neighbors and friends who may be on
 vacation or may need in assistance in searching. There
 are a lot of resources here to help you search, so please
 don't stop. It is obviously a difficult time and they want
 to speak to the public so you can hear it from Kyron's
 family as they come together to share their message.
 Their objective is to keep the focus on Kyron and not
 about anything else.
