Overview of Kyron Horman
If you saw Kyron Horman, you would see a small boy with a huge smile, an oversized graphic tee-shirt that nearly swallowed him, two goofy front teeth, and a pair of metal-framed glasses.
Kyron was a second-grader at Skyline Elementary School in Portland, Oregon. Kyron had relatively poor vision unlike most second graders, but it didn't stop him from seeing and enjoying the world around him. If you peeked through Kyron's glasses, youâ€™d see constant trips to aquariums, zoos, forests, and beaches. Kyron's tiny glass frames could give you glimpses of equations from the advanced math placement he was placed into or flashes of sign language, which he had begun picking up.

You would also be able to see a family and community that loved him very much. Whether he was excelling in school, loving the natural world, or on the occasional trip to Disney World, Kyron saw the beauty of life and shared it with others through his enormous smile.
