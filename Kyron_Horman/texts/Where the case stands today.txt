Kyron's search effort was the most extensive search in Oregon’s history, with the assistance of over 1,300 residents of Oregon and surrounding states. Yet, no one has been arrested or held responsible for the disappearance of Kyron Horman. Law enforcement officials have never named an official suspect. The search for Kyron is still ongoing, but as of May 30, 2019, law enforcement narrowed its searches to less than 100 acres. Kyron's friends, family, and community recently held a vigil for Kyron on the 10th anniversary of his disappearance and honored him with a balloon release.

Today, Kyron Horman would be in his 20s, and has remained missing, despite the $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for his disappearance. Anyone with information about Kyron’s disappearance is urged to contact the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office by calling (503) 823-3333.
