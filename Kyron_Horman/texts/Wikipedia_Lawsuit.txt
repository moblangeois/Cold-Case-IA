In late June 2010, in the midst of the search, Kaine was reportedly told by investigators that Terri had
 offered their landscaper, Rodolfo Sanchez, "a lot of money" to kill her husband.
 [13] Sanchez testified in a
 deposition that Terri approached him to help kill her husband in January 2010, five months before
 Kyron's disappearance; in her own deposition, Terri denied the charge.
 [13] Investigators convinced
 Sanchez to confront Terri while wearing an audio surveillance device, but they were unable to obtain any
 evidence and could not make an arrest. On June 28, Kaine filed for divorce
 order against Terri.
 [14]
 [15] The divorce was granted
 visitation with her daughter.

 During this time, Terri failed two separate

 In August 2010, it was announced that law enforcement were searching for an individual allegedly seen
 by two witnesses sitting inside Terri's truck outside Skyline Elementary the day of the disappearance.
 [19]
 Bruce McCain, a former sheriff for the 
Multnomah County Sheriff's Office, told 
CBS News: "The
 identity of that second person, if he or she existed, could be critical in determining what happened to
 Kyron after 9 a.m. on June 4."
 [19]
 Meanwhile, in July 2010, a 
Multnomah County grand jury 
subpoenaed several friends of Terri, including
 DeDe Spicher, whom Young and Kaine described as having "been in close communication with Terri"
 and "providing Terri with support and advice that is not in the best interests of our son."
 [20] According to
 law enforcement, Spicher was "extremely cooperative" and allowed a search of her property and car, as
 well as enduring three hours of questioning from detectives.
 [20] On the day of Kyron's disappearance,
 Spicher was gardening for a homeowner on Germantown Road in 
Northwest Portland and was allegedly
 unaccounted for during a three hour period,
 [21]
 [22] though Spicher claimed she had never left the
 property.
 [24]
 [23] She also helped Terri purchase an untraceable cell phone after Kaine had moved out of the
 house.
 [25] During this time, Spicher told journalists: "There's this horror that my friend is going
 through. If I thought for a second that she was capable of [foul play], I would not have been there. She
 would not have been my friend in the first place."
 [23]
 In early August 2010, Young, Kaine and the Skyline Elementary School principal were subpoenaed and
 testified during the grand jury hearing.
 [24] In December 2010, it was reported by 
The Oregonian that the
 grand jury had yet to provide compelling evidence yielding a potential 
indictment.
 [26] By November 29,
 2010, search efforts in Kyron's case had cost an estimated $1.4 million, according to county
 commissioners, and yielded 4,257 tips.
 [26]
 In May 2017, it was reported by Portland station 
KGW that a secret grand jury panel continued to hear
 evidence in Kyron's disappearance, and had convened on multiple occasions.
 Kyron's case was described as still "active and ongoing."
 [27] During the report,
 [27] Two months later, in July 2017, law
 enforcement conducted further searches along Skyline Boulevard, but the searches yielded no results.

 [29] Young sought $10 million in

 [29]
 [30] On August 15, 2012, a federal court
 judge denied a motion by Terri to delay the lawsuit.
 [31]
On July 30, 2013, it was announced that Young had dropped the lawsuit against Terri so as not to interfere
 with the ongoing police investigation.
