PORTLAND, Ore. -- The father and stepmother of a missing Portland boy have settled their dispute over when she will move out of their house.

Portland news organizations said Terri Horman has agreed to move out of the house she shared with Kaine Horman by 3 p.m. on Saturday.

Kaine Horman, who's living elsewhere, had asked a judge to order his estranged wife to leave the house this weekend. She had sought more time.

Kaine Horman has filed for divorce and gotten a protective restraining order against her. He says he believes she was involved in the disappearance of 7-year-old Kyron Horman. He's been missing since June 4.

Police have not named her as a suspect.
