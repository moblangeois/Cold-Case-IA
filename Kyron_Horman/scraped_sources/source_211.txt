BOISE, Idaho (CBS2) â€” Its been eight months since five-year-old Michael Joseph Vaughan went missing. Despite the endless searches., even a reward, there's still no answer as to where he may be.

"It's a very emotional situation. We live this every day," said Brandi Neal, Michael's mom.

This week, Michael's parents hosted a booth at the Treefort music festival, with photos and information on Michael, hoping to spread his story.

"Our goal here is to make more people aware of Michael still missing. Today is eight months, and we need everyone's help, " Brandi said.

This was the first time Michael's family made an appearance publicly, but they said the outpour of support from the people has been amazing.

"One person can spread to ten, ten to twenty, and it can just keep going," she said.

The family also hosted a child identification booth in partnership with the Kyron Horman Foundation. People were able to bring their kids, get their photos taken, fingerprints, and additional information about the child in case they are ever lost.

Through all of this, all Michael's family wants is for him to come home.

"We're sad. We miss Michael. We want him home," Brandi said.

The $52,000 reward for Michael's safe return will expire Thursday, March 31.

Those who may have any information on Michael are asked to call the Fruitland Police Department. Anonymous tips can can be sent to findmichael@fruitland.org or to 343COPS.com
