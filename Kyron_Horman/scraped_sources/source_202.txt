PORTLAND, Ore.  — Friday marked 11 years since Kyron Horman disappeared from his elementary school in Northwest Portland.

It was a case that rocked this community to its core, and one so many of us still agonize over today.

Kyron was 7 when he went missing.

He was last seen by his stepmother, Terri, who said she dropped him off at Skyline Elementary School.

No one has ever been charged in the case.

On Friday, Kyron’s mother, Desiree Young, posted a message on Facebook, upset with Multnomah County, suggesting it wasn't doing enough to find her son.

"Things are too quiet and it sounds like Multnomah County may not even know that they are still searching for Kyron. This is not acceptable and I will be taking it to their doorstep," she wrote. "Kyron-I love you I will never stop fighting for you. "

On Friday afternoon, Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt said on Twitter that his office and the sheriff’s office continue their investigation.

He said, "Bringing Kyron Horman home is our number one priority in this case, and we will never lose sight of that.”
