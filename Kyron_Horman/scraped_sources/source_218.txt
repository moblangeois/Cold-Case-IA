PORTLAND, Ore. — Twelve years ago, Kyron Horman disappeared from his elementary school in Northwest Portland.

Then seven years old, Kyron was last seen at Skyline Elementary on June 4, 2010. The last person to see him alive was his stepmother, Terri Moulton, also known as Terri Horman. She said she dropped him off at school.

The case shook the local community, and family members are continuing to push for answers and bring Kyron home.

No one has ever been charged in the case.

On Saturday, authorities released an age progression photo of Kyron. If you recognize him or have any information, call police.

Also on Saturday, Kyron’s motherDesiree Young held a press conference to discuss the search.

"Every time the phone rings, every time someone's at our door, I hear things in the house and I think it's Kyron," she said.

Young said she is not giving up on the search for her son.

"There was a big push in the beginning for everyone to check their properties, mow their grass, check their outhouses, their buildings, sheds, garages, whatever. You need to just look," Young said. "We're not going to find Kyron if we're not looking."

Kyron has brown hair, blue eyes, and wears glasses. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office said he also has a distinct V-shaped strawberry birthmark on his forehead.

There is a $50,000 reward for anyone with information and a gofundme account set up to bring Kyron home.
