PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — The stepmother of missing Oregon boy Kyron Horman was arrested by police in California after her roommate reported that she stole his handgun.

KGW-TV reports that Terri Horman's roommate told authorities the gun was stolen from a safe in his Marysville, California, home. Officers say Hormanhad the weapon when they found her.

Records show she booked into jail on July 4 after failing to show for her arraignment. She was released and later pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor theft charge. Her next court hearing is Dec. 16.

Horman is now using her maiden name, Terri Moulton, a reason her arrest escaped attention at the time.

Horman took then 7-year-old Kyron to his Portland school in 2010 and was the last person known to have seen him. Though she has not been identified as a suspect, Horman told People magazine she relocated to California to flee intense suspicion from Oregonians.
