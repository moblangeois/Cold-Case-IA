Fourteen years since the disappearance of 7-year-old Kyron Horman, the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office has launched a website to highlight unsolved cases such as his.

The website offers general information about ongoing investigations and gives people a place to submit tips. As of Tuesday, the boy’s case is the only one featured.

In a press release announcing the website, Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt said his office is committed to collaborating with investigators if any new evidence surfaces.

The second grader was wearing a black T-shirt with “CSI” in green letters and a hand-print graphic, black cargo pants and black Skechers sneakers with orange trim on June 4, 2010, the day he went missing from Skyline Elementary School in Northwest Portland. He had a distinctive V-shaped strawberry birthmark on his forehead.

Police are asking anyone with information regarding the missing boy to visit the new website, contact the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office directly at 503-988-0560 or email tips@mcso.us.
