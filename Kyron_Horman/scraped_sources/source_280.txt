The family of Kyron Horman marked his 20th birthday with a carwash.

Kyron was just seven years old when he disappeared on June 4, 2010.

His stepmother, Terri Horman, was the last one to see him. She claims she dropped him off at Skyline Elementary that morning, but he never showed up to class and was marked absent.

To this day, his family and friends have not given up hope that he may be out there somewhere.

"Well, absolutely it's super important. We don't have our answer yet, we don't know where Kyron is. We know a lot, but the big thing. We don't have the answer, and that's what we want to get,” said Kyron’s mother, Desiree Young.

Authorities issued a new age progression of Kyron, showing what he might look like now.
