This coming Sunday marks 13 years since Kyron Horman went missing from his elementary school in Northwest Portland.

Kyron would be 20 years old. Authorities released an age-progressed photo of Horman.

Then seven years old, Kyron was last seen at Skyline Elementary on June 4, 2010. The last person to see him alive was his stepmother, Terri Moulton (formerly Terri Horman), who said she dropped him off at school so he could attend his school's science fair.

He has not been found.

The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office said Thursday that the case remains open and active. They say investigators are using advances in software and digital forensics to further their work.

The FBI and Multnomah County District Attorney's Office are also still involved.

There is a $50,000 reward for useful information on his disappearance. You can always call in a tip to the sheriff's office tipline.
