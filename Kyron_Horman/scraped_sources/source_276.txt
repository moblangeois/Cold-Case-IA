An Oregon boy disappeared 12 years ago, and authorities have released a new age-processed photo of him to try to solve the case.

The Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office released the photo on Saturday, June 4, on the 12th anniversary of Kyron Horman’s disappearance, according to a news release. The photo, provided by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, depicts the boy at 19 years old.

“Kyron’s disappearance continues to have a profound impact on our community. We remain just as dedicated to this investigation as we did twelve years ago,” the release says.

Kyron, who was 7 years old when he disappeared in 2010, was last seen at Skyline Elementary School in Portland, Oregon, attending a science fair, officials said.

He was wearing a black shirt with “CSI” written in green letters and a hand-print graphic, along with black cargo pants, white socks and black Skechers with orange trim the day he disappeared, the release says. He also may have been wearing glasses.

Kyron has brown hair and blue eyes and also has a “distinct V-shaped strawberry birthmark on his forehead.”

His and his family’s DNA is registered and being searched against the national DNA database, the release says. The boy’s dental records and X-rays have also been uploaded to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons system.

Anyone with information about Kyron’s disappearance is asked to call the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office at (503) 988-0560 or the NCMEC at 1-800-THE-LOST, the release says. There is a $50,000 reward available to anyone who may have information that helps solve the boy’s disappearance.
