Portland, Ore – It has been exactly 12 years from today (June 4) since Kyron Horman went missing. Kyron was last seen leaving the Science Fair at his school, Skyline Elementary School in Portland on June 4, 2010.
The National Center for Missing & Exploited children is releasing a New, age-progressed photo of what Kyron could look-like today at age 19. There is also a video produced by NCMEC which you can download here. The NCMEC encourages eveyone to share the photo and video on your various social media platforms.
The search for Kyron remains open and active. The Multnomah County Sheriffs office along with the District Attorney’s Office and the FBI continue to actively pursue all investigative leads. The Major Crime partners will continue to do so until Kyron is located.
