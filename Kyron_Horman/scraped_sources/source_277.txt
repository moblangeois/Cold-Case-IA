Sunday will mark the 13-year anniversary of the disappearance of Kyron Horman. Kyron was last seen at Skyline Elementary School in Portland, Oregon, on June 4, 2010, attending his school’s science fair. He has not been seen or heard from since. At the time, he was seven years old.

Kyron has brown hair, blue eyes and wears glasses. He also has a distinct V-shaped strawberry birthmark on his forehead.

On the day of his disappearance, Kyron was wearing a black t-shirt with "CSI" in green letters and a handprint graphic. He was also wearing black cargo pants, white socks and black Sketchers sneakers with orange trim. Kyron may have had his glasses on at the time.

Kyron's disappearance continues to have a profound impact on our community. The case remains open and active. Investigators are using advances in software, digital forensics, and geospatial technology to support and advance their work. In collaboration with our Major Crimes Team partners, the Multnomah County District Attorney's Office and the FBI, detectives are pursuing all legitimate investigative leads and will continue to do so until Kyron is located.

The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) has provided an age-progressed photo of Kyron.
